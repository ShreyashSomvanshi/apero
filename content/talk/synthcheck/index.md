+ Our focus is on developing an image classification model to distinguish between real
images and those generated by AI algorithms. It can address the rising concerns surrounding the authenticity of digital content and specify misinformation. By using advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to contribute to the image forensics, ensuring the credibility and trustworthiness of visual media in the era of AI-generated content.
